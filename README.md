#AngularJS jQueryUI
This is going to be the place where I try to get [jQueryUI](http://jqueryui.com/) integrated with [AngularJS](http://www.angularjs.org/) by using directives.  This is more of a practice for me to get familiar with writing directives, but if it helps someone else then so be it.  Will be making updates as I can, which will be slow at times.
